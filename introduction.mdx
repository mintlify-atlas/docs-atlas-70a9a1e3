## Key Features

### LazyVim Foundation

Built on the powerful [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.github.io/) starter template, providing a solid, performant base with sensible defaults and lazy-loading for optimal startup times.

### Extensive Theme Collection

With **151 Alacritty themes** included, you can easily switch between aesthetics to match your mood or workspace:

- Catppuccin (Mocha, Latte, Frappe, Macchiato)
- Tokyo Night variants
- Gruvbox (Dark & Light)
- Nord & Nordic
- Rose Pine family
- And 140+ more

### Obsidian.nvim Integration

Seamlessly work with your Obsidian vault directly from Neovim:

```lua
workspaces = {
  {
    name = "personal",
    path = "~/Documents/vault",
  },
}
```

### Vim-Centric Workflow

Consistent Vim keybindings across all tools:

- **Tmux**: Vi mode in copy mode, Vim-style pane navigation
- **AeroSpace**: `alt-h/j/k/l` for window focus, matching Vim movements
- **Neovim**: Full LazyVim keybinding suite

## Quick Preview

### Alacritty Configuration

```toml
general.import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml"
]

[window]
padding.x = 10
padding.y = 10
opacity = 0.8
blur = true

[font]
normal.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
size = 16
```

### Tmux Vim Bindings

```bash
# Vim keybindings in copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# Vim-like selection and copy
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send -X copy-selection
```

## Who Is This For?

This configuration is ideal for:

- Theme enthusiasts who enjoy customizing their terminal aesthetics
- macOS users looking for a tiling window manager experience
- Obsidian users who want to edit notes without leaving the terminal

3. **Consistency**: Vim keybindings across all tools
4. **Aesthetics**: Beautiful themes and visual harmony
5. **Productivity**: Thoughtful defaults that reduce friction
